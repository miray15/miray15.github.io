The purpose of this app is to showcase my new skills as a software developer to friends, family, and individuals while fundraising for the Chicago Marathon race I am participating in early October 2023. 

The website has two themes. The theme of the home page is "Going back in time to the 90s" and the rest of the pages are intended to be modern. I want to show individuals who visit my site to see that I am capable of rudimentary coding as well as more advanced skills such as using bootstrap. 

The features I want this website to have is functionality on all screen resolutions, which has proven to be a challenge. Because I want the pages to each be of a different theme, that has also been challenging. 

I am considering redoing this application to make it using React.js
