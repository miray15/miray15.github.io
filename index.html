  <p>Welcome to Mimi's first website, to support an awesome cause!</p>



  <h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstley">Why I'm running the 2023 Chicago
      Marathon</a></h1>


  <p> This is a picture of my mom and dad. If you know me, you know my mom and dad meant the world to me. What you might
    not know is they both died of heart attacks before I turned 30. </p>

  <p> As tragic as this is, it has motivated me to take control of my health. I am running the 2023 Chicago Marathon for
    my parents, for my family, and for myself. <br> As long as I live, I will do everything in my power to take care of
    my own heart and everyone's heart around me ❤️ </p>
